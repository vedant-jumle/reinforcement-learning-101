## How to Use

### 1. Play the Game
```bash
python manual_play.py
```

### 2. Run Examples
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python examples/simple_agent.py
```

### 3. Build Your Own Agent
```python
from game.game_engine import DroneGame

game = DroneGame(render_mode='human')
state = game.reset()

while not done:
    action = your_policy(state)
    state, reward, done, info = game.step(action)
    game.render()
```

## What Makes This Special

1. **Complete but Simple** - Everything works, nothing overcomplicated
2. **Clean API** - Easy to understand and extend
3. **Well Documented** - Code comments, README, tutorials
4. **Educational** - Perfect for learning RL concepts
5. **Tested** - Automated tests ensure it works
6. **Extensible** - Easy to add features (wind, obstacles, levels)

## Connection to Forza-RL

This project teaches the same concepts you'll need:

| Delivery Drone | Forza-RL |
|---------------|----------|
| Thrust control | Throttle/Brake |
| Rotation control | Steering |
| Land safely | Stay on track |
| Speed management | Lap time optimization |
| Fuel constraint | Tire wear |
| State observation | Telemetry + Vision |
| Continuous control | PWM input |
| Episode-based | Race-based |

The **architecture is transferable**:
- Same API pattern (reset, step, state, action, reward)
- Same RL algorithms will work
- Same training patterns apply
- Same debugging approaches

## Performance

- **Game FPS**: 60 FPS (smooth gameplay)
- **Training Speed**: ~1000 episodes/minute (headless mode)
- **State Complexity**: 15 dimensions (manageable)
- **Action Complexity**: 2³ = 8 discrete actions (simple)

## Success Metrics

**For Manual Play:**
- Landing success rate
- Average fuel remaining
- Number of attempts to master

**For RL Agents:**
- Episode reward
- Landing success rate
- Steps to landing
- Convergence speed
- Generalization (different starting positions)
